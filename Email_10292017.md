Yep, sounds reasonable.  
Might also be a good idea to use ANOVA between the groups â€“ clearly Trump vs Kasich or Cruz would be distinct (t-test for that),
but ANOVA then could include all three, on the basis of either voting % or tweet %, or maybe a ratio.

# Resulting Direction: 
## 1. T-Test to see if Kasich, Trump and Cruz are distinct 
Details:
* 3 T-tests
* KC, KT, TC
* Test Tweet % and voting percentage.


## 2. ANOVA including all three 
Details:
Need to figure out what the structure for this would be.
* What data table(dataframe) structure do I use  310 or 186?
* How do I report out on it?
