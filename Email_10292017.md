Yep, sounds reasonable.  
Might also be a good idea to use ANOVA between the groups â€“ clearly Trump vs Kasich or Cruz would be distinct (t-test for that),
but ANOVA then could include all three, on the basis of either voting % or tweet %, or maybe a ratio.

Need to figure out what the structure for this would be.
