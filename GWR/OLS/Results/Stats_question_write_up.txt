Why would step() output different outcomes when a better fit can be produced.
I have two datasets model that in my understanding should have the same relationships with a set of variables.
IE some of the independent variables used in each are as such (data4a <- 1- data4b),
and the dependent variable for CaseA has the same relationship to the dependent variable for CaseB. 

#These data are the same for CaseA and CaseB:
df$data1 <- log(explanatory variable)
df$data2 <- explanatory variable
df$data3 <- explanatory variable #(between 0 and 1)

#These data are related to the Case, IE CaseA or CaseB.
df$data4a <- measured value #(between 0 and 1)
df$data4b <- 1 - df$data4a  #(between 0 and 1)
df$data5a <- measured value #(between 0 and 1)
df$data5b <- 1 - df$data5a  #(between 0 and 1)


df$perc_a <- measured value #(between 0 and 1)
dfb$perc_b <- 1 - df$perc_a  #(between 0 and 1)

ModelA <- lm(perc_a~df$data4a+df$data5a+df$data1+df$data2+df$data3,data=df)
ModelB <- lm(perc_b~df$data4b+df$data5b+df$data1+df$data2+df$data3,data=df)

stepA <- step(ModelA)
stepB <- step(ModelB)

stepA$call$formula
RETURNS: 
perc_a~df$data4a+df$data1+df$data3

stepB$call$formula
RETURNS:
perc_b~df$data4b+df$data5b


stepA: outcome is a model with a 0.73 adjusted R^2.
stepB: outcome is a model with a 0.05 R^2.

If I plug in the same formula that comes out of StepA, I get a .73 R^2, so the relationships is still the same.
I understand why they get the same R^2 under the same equation, but I don't understand why they aren't producing the same outcomes within step().
